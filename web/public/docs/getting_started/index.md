# Getting started

TerraTinker is a tool for transforming geospatial data into Minecraft worlds.

_Please note that TerraTinker is still in development and some features may not work as expected._

The process consists of multiple steps described in the following sections.

## [1. Select area](/map)

The region selection tab is used to define the transformation from the real world to the Minecraft coordinate system and define the parameters of the Minecraft map.

## [2. Create layers](/layers)

The layers tab is used to define the layers of the Minecraft world. Each layer is a separate program that transforms the input data into Minecraft blocks.

## [3. Preview](/preview)

The preview tab is used to preview the final world on a smaller scale. It is useful for testing the layers before publishing the world.

## [4. Publish](/publish)

The publish tab is used to create a Minecraft world from the layers. The world can be downloaded for local use.
