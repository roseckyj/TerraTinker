# Publish

The publish tab is used to create a Minecraft world from the layers. The world can be downloaded for local use. This process may take a while depending on the size of the world and the number of layers.

The final ZIP file can be extracted and used as a Minecraft world. The world can be used in singleplayer or on a server.
