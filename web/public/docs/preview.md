# Preview

The preview tab is used to preview the final world on a smaller scale. It is useful for testing the layers before publishing the world.

The region used for generating the preview is marked with a dashed line in the map.

The final size of the preview is 4×4 chunks (64×64 blocks).

**Warning**: For very large (along Y axis) worlds the preview may never load. This is a limitation of the used library.

## Controls

The preview can be dragged around with the mouse. The mouse wheel can be used to zoom in and out.
