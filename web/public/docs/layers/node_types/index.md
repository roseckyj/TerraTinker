# Node types

There are multiple general types of nodes:

-   **Generic node**: generic transformation of data
-   **[Fork node](node_types/fork)**: for single input they can output multiple values
-   **[Action node](node_types/action)**: can be a part of the Execution flow. Performs some action, like placing a block.
